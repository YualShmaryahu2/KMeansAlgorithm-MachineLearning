# KMeansAlgorithm-MachineLearning
The K-means algorithm is a popular clustering method for finding a partition of N unlabeled observations into K distinct clusters, where K is a parameter of the method. In this repostiroy this algorithm will be implemented in both Python and C.

In this repository the KMeans algorithm will be implemented with in 2 files:
kmeans.c
kmeans.py
